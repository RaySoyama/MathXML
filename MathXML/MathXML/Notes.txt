Using this as a place to jot down notes, and also to write down my thoughts so who ever is reading this can understand my work-flow/thought process.

After reading the test description doc, here are a few things that came to mind.

- I have never parsed a XML before, I wonder hard hard this wil be.
- The "object" that the XML will be parsed into will be very simple, just (so far) 4 different values.
- Each "calculation" is actually wrapped by a "redundant" <Add></Add> tag, so I'm curious on what that should mean

After looking over the math.xml file, I noticed

- Some descriptions end with a semi-colon, others don't.
- Some are missing the "Miscellaneous info" 


Here is how I will structure my code
- Parse XML to a List of Objects ("hard part")
- Do operations, and print to console
- How to handle bad input
- Are the values floats of ints? (I used floats, I also couldn't really tell because there was no example output of the division calculations)

Mid Programming
- I wanted to use some inheritance to for the operation data class, but parsing it into different operations is going to be a pain, so I'm just going to handle that in the operation class itself
